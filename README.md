# explanation to run the code 
## for question3, I seperate it to q31 folder which represent the first part and q32 folder which represent the part for bonus question.

### run code of q31:
####     I will uplode my extension code, node.js and this README.md all into Q31 folder. please download and unzip it into some where at you computer, then open a terminal and use the `cd` command to go to this directory. 
####  pre-setup the environment as mentioned in README.md file in the Q3_driever from Canvas. before run the code, we first need to use command `touch url` to make a file called 'url', becuase the test will check this file for the output. 
#### suggest to open the second terminal, the previous terminal can be used to host a node.js server.  the second one can be used to run the test code 
##### `brew install node` can be used in Mac OS to install node.js
##### `scoop install nodejs` can be used in windows to install node.js
#### after installing, run the command `node node.js` from the current directory
#### in the second termianl run the command `python run_test1.py ../q31 http://localhost:2000/url`
#### the recording information can be found from the first terminal along with the running 
#### the test result can be found from the second terminal
